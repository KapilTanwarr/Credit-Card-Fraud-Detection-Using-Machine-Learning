# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project addresses the critical issue of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. We used logistic regression to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

# Features:
Preprocessed a highly imbalanced dataset.
Applied under-sampling to create a balanced training dataset.
Evaluated the model with accuracy metrics.
# Results:
Accuracy on training data: XX%
Accuracy on testing data: YY%
# Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
# Future Improvements:
Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
Use techniques like SMOTE for oversampling instead of under-sampling.
